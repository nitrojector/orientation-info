# Orientation Info

[![Build Status](http://ci.jector.io/buildStatus/icon?job=orientationInfo)](http://ci.jector.io/job/orientationInfo/)

---

This app started out as a testing ground for FTC robotics, particularly concerning orientation. It allows for a clear representation of usable processed data from different phone sensors (i.e. 9 axes IMUs)

It can be used for debuging and visualizing angles in the FTC field for easier programming. The angles obtained from different sensors can also be temporarily logged for use.
